### Preamble:

This is a heavily modified version of [Valetudo by Hypfer](https://github.com/Hypfer/Valetudo), enhanced by me since I found too many features missing in the original package when I've tried to use it for the first time. Next is a quick list of changes first appeared here:

* Ability to select multiple saved zones at once;
* Selected zones optionally shown at the map tab to see and edit what's actually going to be cleaned;
* Configurable virtual walls and forbidden zones, finally! (requires Gen2)
* Scheduled zoned cleaning - when you do not need to clean the whole house;
* Ability to specify the number of iterations to clean the same zone multiple times;
* Showing device status on the map, and also dynamically switching buttons;
* Experimental ability to save/restore maps;
* Multilanguage support, currently available in bg/de/en/es/fi/fr/hu/it/nl/ru;
* A telegram bot software for controlling the vacuum from the outside world;
* Full support of room cleaning (requires Gen2 with firmware 2008+).

You can add or improve your own native language support by using ./client/locales/en.json template as an example and sending a PR.

### Getting map picture for integrations
* [valetudo-mapper](https://github.com/rand256/valetudo-mapper) - a companion service for generating PNG Maps
* You can also try to request a simple map from Valetudo RE itself via http at `/api/simple_map`, but it shouldn't be called too often since resources of the vacuum are limited.
