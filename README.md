### Preamble:

This is a fork of [Valetudo by Hypfer](https://github.com/Hypfer/Valetudo), created by me since I found too many features missing in the original package when I've tried to use it for the first time. 

Features added lately:

* Cleaning queue, allowing the use of zoned cleaning with more than 5 zones via enqueuing any number of additional cleanups at once;
* Possibility to enqueue additional zones and segments during cleaning or additional goto spots during the movement;
* Ability to run Goto + Spot cleaning (by long pressing "Goto" button on the map tab);
* Selecting the destination for the device to go when the cleaning is finished (configured globally in settings or per-cleaning by long pressing "Start" button on the map tab);
* Visual preview and edit of zones and rooms for corresponding scheduled cleaning.

And this is a quick list of features first appeared here:

* Ability to select multiple saved zones at once;
* Selected zones optionally shown at the map tab to see and edit what's actually going to be cleaned;
* Configurable virtual walls and forbidden zones (requires Gen2);
* Ability to see the actual map of cleanings that were finished recently;
* Scheduled zoned cleaning - when you do not need to clean the whole house;
* Scheduled rooms cleaning - the same thing for newer firmware of Gen2;
* Ability to specify the number of iterations to clean the same zone multiple times;
* Display device's status on the map, as well as a set of quick action buttons that are dynamically switching at state changes;
* Multilanguage support, currently available in bg/ca/cz/de/en/es/fi/fr/hu/it/lv/nl/ru/pl;
* A telegram bot software for controlling the vacuum from the outside world;
* Experimental ability to SAVE and RESTORE the main map (with per-map list of saved zones and spots);
* Full support of room cleaning (requires Gen2 with firmware 2008+).

You can add or improve your own native language support by using ./client/locales/en.json template as an example and sending a PR.

### Getting map picture for integrations
* [valetudo-mapper](https://github.com/rand256/valetudo-mapper) - a companion service for generating PNG maps;
* You can also try to request a simple map from Valetudo RE itself via http at `/api/simple_map`, but it shouldn't be called too often since resources of the vacuum are limited.
