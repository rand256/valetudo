### Preamble:

This is a modified version of [Valetudo by Hypher](https://github.com/Hypfer/Valetudo), _enhanced_ by me since I found too many features missing in the original package when I've tried to use it for the first time. Next is a quick list of changes first appeared here:

* Ability to select multiple saved zones at once;
* Selected zones optionally shown at the map tab to see and edit what's actually going to be cleaned;
* Renaming zones and spots, since why not?
* Configurable virtual walls and forbidden zones, finally!
* Scheduled zoned cleaning - when you do not need to clean the whole house;
* Ability to specify in webGUI the number of iterations to clean the same zone multiple times;
* Showing status of the device on the map; 
* Set of dynamically appearing buttons on the map to better control device from there;
* Experimental ability to save/restore maps;
* Random visual changes: using different colors and icons here and there, some behavioral changes when working with maps and so on.

**Also webUI localization is supported since 0.4.0-RE7!**
Currently available for en/de/ru/bg. Add your own native language support by editing ./client/locales/en.json template and sending a PR.
